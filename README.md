## What is Budgeteer?
Budgeteer is a budget monitoring tool that allows you to track
project budgets. A project in the sense of Budgeteer contains a set of
budgets each defined in a currency. For each person that contributes to the
project, you set up a daily rate in that currency. Budgeteer allows you to
import working hours and does the math for you, so that you always know where
your budgets are heading.
